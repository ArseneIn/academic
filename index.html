                        <p>Over this module I deepened my grasp of core research‐methodology concepts—particularly
                            mixed‐methods design, sampling strategies, and ethical protocols. Aligning qualitative
                            interviews with quantitative surveys helped me frame a cohesive case‐study approach for
                            boutique owners in Murama Cell, ensuring I could explore both measurable patterns and lived
                            experiences.</p>

                        <p>My learning process was iterative. I struggled to balance breadth (“What is DFL?”) with depth
                            (“How does it translate into record keeping?”). I drafted multiple versions of my problem
                            statement and sought peer feedback—an exercise that clarified my main objective: assessing
                            how DFL influences boutique management and informing a tailored digital tool.</p>

                        <p>The biggest challenge was crafting focused research objectives. My first draft contained
                            five; after reflection I consolidated them into three precise, actionable items. This
                            process taught me the value of paring back complexity to ensure feasibility.</p>

                                <p>I chose a single-case study of boutique owners in Murama Cell to capture both
                                    numerical trends and rich personal insights, integrating quantitative surveys with
                                    qualitative interviews.
                                    This design allowed me to measure, for example, the percentage of owners using
                                    mobile money for record-keeping, while also exploring in depth how they interpret
                                    and apply digital tools in daily operations. By focusing on one well-defined
                                    community, I could iteratively compare survey results against interview narratives,
                                    ensuring that my findings reflected both breadth and depth of DFL’s impact.

                                <p>I first applied purposive sampling to recruit 59 boutique owners who had been
                                    operating for at least six months and managed their shops independently, ensuring
                                    relevance to my objectives.
                                    Recognizing that some informal traders lacked formal listings, I then employed
                                    snowball sampling, asking each participant to refer peers within Murama. This
                                    two-stage approach widened my reach to include owners outside official channels,
                                    enriching the diversity of digital-literacy experiences captured.

                                <p>To quantify DFL and management practices, I created a mostly close-ended

                        focus on urban businesses, overlooking peri-urban owners in Rwanda. The literature provided a
                        theoretical base but failed to account for the nuanced realities on the ground, reinforcing my
